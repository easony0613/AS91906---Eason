# AS91906---Eason
This is the program for AS91906

The game where you fight the coolest boss in the world.... Myself!

To use the adding_quiz file, you must add one question at a time. When the program asks you if you want to add more questions, select no. This is because there is a bug in that program I do not know how to fix. 
If you add more question, and then dump it in the end all together, the question will not be correctly added into the json file. The question and the answer will be added correctly, while the choices will be
the same throughout every question you added together. 

Therefore, add one question at a time. When you finish adding one question, change the value of counter. If you have 29 questions in your json quiz currently, make sure you change the counter to 29. 
After adding another question, you will have 30 question in your json file. Before running the code again, change the counter variable to 30. This allows the question to be added correctly.
